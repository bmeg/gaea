* Data
** +++++ compound gene target: split and make list
** ++++ add AUC to ccle converter
** +++ get mutation type on edge between variants and genes
** +++ get symbol on the edge between variants and genes
** +++ create cohorts for TCGA
** ++ G2P (talk to walsh)
** + ML signatures
** + Literome - https://ohsu.app.box.com/files/0/f/21493766712/G2P_Data
** pubmed - ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/baseline
** PDB
** support DMS queries (georgia)
** ETL of existing data (TCGA, signatures): work with DMS
** Import SIF (pathways)
* Machine Learning
** + Create schema for SVM
** merge all ML libs in bmeg org into ladder
* Visualization
** ++ Allow searching for multiple genes at once
** Gene page
*** Histogram of copy number values for this gene
*** G2P, pubmed titles
** Expression page
*** histogram of expression vector
** Cohort page
*** Oncoprint of expression vectors 
** Compound page
*** show some kind of summary of response curve
** + all state of application encoded in window location (redux and router)
** + onco.js add sequence for edges
** fix response curves on cohort page to account for inconsistent x-axis points
** add more visualizations
*** cohort page: show what are the top 10 mutated genes in this cohort - bar chart
*** precalculate counts for each type, if there are less than 30 show drop down
* Protograph
** ++++ test query: 30 most mutated genes in a cohort
** combine protograph with protobuf schemas to fill out properties and types for describing the full graph schema
** create conformance test
* Ophion
** +++ add step for getting union of keys
** ++ support indexing
** ++ sync to Kyle's protobuf - add edge label step and write api to ophion
** for results, put gid at top level, change 'type' to 'level'
** provide support for querying multiple graphs
** pass and extend Ophion conformance test
* Server
** +++ stream results as you get them
** +++ add elastic search for vertex types (case insensitve with prefix matching)
** improve caching in server for queries (proxy to memcache for round-robin expiration)
* Agents
** + setup agent interface
** + run Heskett's clustering agent
** make agent for adding edges between samples and genes
** align signature code with protograph, make an agent
** create tests for protograph
* Site
** ++++ summary of project to number of samples in project
** +++ institute a site update page with one card per update
** +++ give some attention to the other tabs
** google analytics
** make github site
* Support
** Write docs for everyone! and everything!
** help Chris
** track issues in jira
