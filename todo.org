* Data
** Add in AUC and drug target (edge from compound to gene)
** Literome
** G2P (talk to walsh)
** support DMS queries (georgia)
** fill in kafka topics with bioschema messages
** ETL of existing data (TCGA, signatures): work with DMS
** Make edges between samples and mutations (mutation summary)
** Import SIF (pathways)
* Visualization
** all state of application encoded in window location (redux and router)
** onco.js add sequence for edges
** add more visualizations
*** cohort page: show what are the top 10 mutated genes in this cohort - bar chart
*** precalculate counts for each type, if there are less than 30 show drop down
* Protograph
** Create support for ingesting messages into edges and edge properties
** create conformance test
** combine protograph with protobuf schemas to fill out properties and types for describing the full graph schema
* Ophion
** sync to Kyle's protobuf - add edge label step and write api to ophion
** pass and extend Ophion conformance test
** support indexing
* Server
** streaming upload through port 80
** add titan thread pool
** stream results as you get them
** add some kind of caching in server for queries
* Agents
** setup agent interface
** run Heskett's clustering agent
** make agent for adding edges between samples and genes
** align signature code with protograph, make an agent
** create tests for protograph
* Support
** Write docs for everyone! and everything!
** help Chris
